# recursive-newton
presents Newton’s Universal Law of Gravitation through a recursive model, handling both classical two-body interactions and single-body interactions from a Radiation Source center (D=0) to its Surface (D=1, D=2, etc.). I’ve included the Earth example, explained the Degrees of Surface Interaction (D=0 to D=2), and provided visual graph placeholders.
